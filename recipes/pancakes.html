        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A pancake is a breakfast dish, a flat cake that's made by pouring batter into a hot pan and frying it on both sides. Many people like to eat their pancakes with a drizzle of maple syrup.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in milk, melted butter, and egg until combined. Let batter rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add butter.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the hot skillet, about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the sides and center of each pancake, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until the bottom is golden, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
