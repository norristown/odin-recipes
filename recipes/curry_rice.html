            <li>Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.</li>
            <li>Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. Add potatoes.
